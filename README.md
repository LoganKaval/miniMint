# miniMint
A Way to Break Down Linux Mint Into a Basic TTY Prompt!
Sometimes I Want to Install Debian GNU/Linux, But I Have Weird Hardware That Won't Let Me.
So, I Install Linux Mint, And Debloat it. 
There's Not Much Bloat Considering it's a Whole Linux Distribution With a Desktop Environment and Display Manager.
